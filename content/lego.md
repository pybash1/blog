I'd like to consider myself a builder. And in all this time, I've been building or at least *trying to*, I realized something. There are two types of builders in this world.

1. Those who build by following instructions on the LEGO box, and
2. those who dump all the pieces in box, and create something out of their imagination.

I have myself transitioned from 1 to 2. There's nothing bad in 1, its just you need evolve from it, but some people just get stuck in it. The 2 tribe, let's call them *freeformers*[^1] builds the LEGO set by following the instructions for the first time, but **only** the first time. They learn the **how** from the instructions but not the **what**. And the following builds are pure imagination, which is why they sometimes turn out lopsided and sometimes beautiful.

While, on the other hand, the 1 group, lets call them *instructioner*s[^1], just keep on iterating the instructions, this doesn't create anything valuable. Because, every time, what they're building has already been built by someone else. Essentially, making it worthless.

This is not about [LEGO](https://lego.com)s. This is about building and crafting just about anything. These same principles apply to building of any sort. Be it building software, or pottery, or arts. A really good example for the same would be that no one wants to buy a replica to the Mona Lisa, and they aren't worth anything either. The worth is in the real Mona Lisa, which is a unique and original creation. There are plenty other examples of this, in every field.

We should focus on building things we love. As this produces original products and ideas. I find it rather difficult to build things I don't want to. Talking about myself here, I did enjoy when I was able to build something by following a tutorial, I used to be happy, but that joy didn't last long. But now, when I build something I imagined, and someone reaches out to me asking about it, that joy lasts a life time, trust me.

> *Mindless joy is a virtue in itself*

I wouldn't say the *instructioners* lack creativity, but rather I think they lack its application. When I was in [[the devils workshop|tutorial hell]]
