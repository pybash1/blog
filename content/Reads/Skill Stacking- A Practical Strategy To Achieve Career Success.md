* Note: key takeaway: build("stack") multiple skills
my addition: master or atleast be good at ur entire skill stack.


## Highlights
* “A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night, and in between does what he wants to do.”
* * Productivity and time-management * Persuasion * Web design * Writing * Accounting * Drawing * Project management * Marketing * Public speaking * Teaching
* I’m not a master at any of these skills. For example, I have poor drawing skills, reasonable web design skills, average marketing skills, solid productivity skills, and good but not great writing skills. But when I stacked all my skills on top of each other and started blogging, it proved to be a success.
  * **Note**: hmm, he implies that you need to know a lot of things but not neccessarilly be a master at one. while i agree, having multiple skills is good, but his point somewhat sounds like hes telling us to be a "jack of all trades" - which i completely disagree with.
* I don’t like the word talent because it implies nature, I prefer skill because it implies nurture
  * **Note**: nature <> nurture sounds really nice.
* “Successwise, you’re better off being good at two complementary skills than being excellent at one.”
* “If you think extraordinary talent and a maniacal pursuit of excellence are necessary for success, I say that’s just one approach, and probably the hardest. When it comes to skills, quantity often beats quality.”
* Productivity is the mother of all skills.
  * **Note**: i dont really know why, but i just stopped trying to be productive, it just doesnt work for me. just do what i want to with a definite set of goals, that kinda gets everything done quick.
* When you write in a clear and simple way, you can express yourself like very few people can.
  * **Note**: yet another reason why i love writing
* A basic understanding of why we do what we do can help us to understand ourselves and others. You don’t have to become a therapist. As long as you know the basics of psychology, you’re better at dealing with other people; and yourself.
  * **Note**: i really need to learn more about and use psychology. it can be so powerful provided its used correctly.
* This is the art and science of communicating in a way that resonates with people. When we’re good at persuasion, we are better at leadership, sales, holding conversations, public speaking, at anything else that requires influencing others. Influence is more about effective communication than anything else.
  * **Note**: this is just a branch of psychology i feel.
* Answer that question for yourself. Write down what skills and qualities that person should have. Then, become that person by acquiring those skills.
  * **Note**: this is a really good way of thinking.
