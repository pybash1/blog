* Note: ideation -> brainstorming -> drafting -> writing -> reviewing - this post deals with the entire thing


## Highlights
* The easiest way to get demotivated about writing is to compare your first post to the polished output of your favorite writers, conclude you’ll never get that good, and give up.
* They make more dumb/annoying/incentive-misaligned decisions than Ghost (e.g. the full-screen “subscribe” modal popping up before you’ve read the post), but they’re good enough.
  * **Note**: lol
* More-involved feedback from a few draft readers.
  * **Note**: i think i should ask people to read my drafts too
* Examples of good titles:
  * **Note**: does this mean, good titles dont exist?
* * I’d suggest not copying famous writers’ tendency to use “artsy” or “literary” titles, unless your goal is to be artsy or literary. (That’s a fine goal to have but not really what this piece is about.)
  * **Note**: what does artsy or literary refer to here exactly? are pun-ny titles or a little obscure ones bad to start out? i dont get it.
* You’ve heard of microaggressions. Now try microhumor. It’s things that aren’t a joke in the laugh-out-loud told-by-a-comedian sense, but still put the tiniest ghost of a smile on your reader’s face while they’re skimming through them.
  * **Note**: this is a very nice way to keep readers entertained
* Triggering an angry journalist, Internet outrage mob, or both. I think most people overestimate both the risk of this happening, and the downsides if it does, because it often happens in high-profile ways (e.g. the New York Times doxxing Scott Alexander). Scott was both very high-profile and wrote about particularly charged topics (politics and social justice), often in a style that wasn’t very robust to being taken out of context.
  * **Note**: this seems like a long way to go before this would happen, why would beginners worry about this?
