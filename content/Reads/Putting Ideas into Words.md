* Note: talks about writing in general too, not just ideas


## Highlights
* Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones you thought of while you were writing it.
* You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothing of what's in your head, only what you wrote.
* Arguably what such people are doing is putting ideas into words in their heads.
* in both cases I learned a lot from writing about them.
  * **Note**: this is why i love writing(and reading), you not only get a clearer picture of the thing your writing about but also learn a ton of other things related to it.
* I'm not saying that writing is the best way to explore all ideas. If you have ideas about architecture, presumably the best way to explore them is to build actual buildings.
  * **Note**: so the basic idea is to "do" to explore no matter the field
* Ideas can feel complete
  * **Note**: this happened to novelty i feel?
* Machinery and circuits are formal languages.
