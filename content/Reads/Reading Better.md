## Highlights
* When it comes to reading, you donâ€™t need to finish what you start. You can quit.
* Skim a lot of books. Read a few. Immediately re-read the best ones twice.
  * **Note**: this a rather unique philosophy... altho it does resonate with me, but i was always kind of schooled to complete books, and not just quit them.
* If you just read one book on a topic, odds are you have a lot of blind spots in your knowledge. Synoptical reading is reading various books and articles on the same topic, finding and evaluating the contradictions, and forming an opinion.
* Writing is reflection.
  * **Note**: i very very much agree with this. reading and writing go completely hand in hand. writing not only expresses your thoughts but also points out the gaps and flaws you dont always realize while reading.
