* Note: idea: try to solve problems that make an impact. hard problems dont neccessarilly make an impact.


## Highlights
* I happily add “built a state-of-the-art library for numerical integration, with novel improvements on the best techniques in the academic literature” to my resume.
  * **Note**: i just found this funny lol
* get assigned an adviser who doesn’t tell me to take easier courses
  * **Note**: sounds like he is telling people to just do what they want and not follow an "advisor" of sorts?
* a lot of smart college students end up with the idea that “solving hard technical problems” is the best thing they can do with their life.
* Probably because that’s the only thing they’ve been rewarded for over the past 15 years.
* your solution is evaluated on one dimension
* performance ceiling (an A+) is low
* If you try to maximize your rewards under this reward function, you’ll end up looking for trickier and trickier puzzles that you can get an A+ on.
* A solution’s performance has many different dimensions (speed, reliability, usability, repeatability, cost, …)—you probably don’t even know what all the dimensions are, let alone which are the most important
* most graduates of elite schools—including me—start out being completely unable to identify which work is actually important.
  * **Note**: trying to demean elite schools(ivy leagues), perhaps? or is just pointing out the mistakes people in elite schools make? not quite clear.
* my root goal was to use my skills to get the most possible leverage on improving the world.
  * **Note**: "improving the world" is quite the goal
* important ones are ultimately more fun!
  * **Note**: what about [[procrastination]]?
