* Note: i agree building your own tools is very nice, but is it viable to build everything for yourself from scratch? kinda difficult and impractical i feel. finding a tool which fits you sounds better to me.


## Highlights
* Mira for keeping track of people I know, why they’re interesting, and what we’ve talked about.
  * **Note**: i'm building brief on this. the ui is very much borrowed, just the idea changed a bit and simplified for myself.
* Noct for backing up and syncing all my files across computers and the cloud. Noct doesn’t have a graphical UI, just a command-line tool.
  * **Note**: git is enough?
* Frieden as a public availability calendar, showing when I’m free or busy. Thingboard for more free-form Post-its-on-the-wall style brainstorming.
  * **Note**: streams is a similar alternative to this. although not exactly.

linus(thesephist) has his own stream: [stream @ thesephist.com](https://stream.thesephist.com) which inspired the building of streams by judah btw

cron is enough? although i don't use it correctly.
* draw, a collaborative whiteboard, best used with my iPad Pro and Apple Pencil.
  * **Note**: excalidraw is enough?
* each person remembers and processes information a little differently
* I can build the tools that exactly conform to my workflows, rather than constructing my workflows around the tools available to me.
  * **Note**: i 100% agree with the dont bend your workflow to suit the tools part. tbh, this doesnt work for me either. if i use a tool which doesnt fit me, ill forget to use it very soon no matter how much i force it on myself. thats how i figured my current tools, obsidian, streams, etc. work for me cuz i nver forgot about them.
* My productivity tools, especially my notes and contacts, are the load-bearing tools of my life.
  * **Note**: shows how significant notes and people or connections are in life. i should not neglect them as much as i do. they're pretty damn important.
* Cost. I spend a total of $6/month for a single small DigitalOcean server in hosting all of my personal tools, and if DO happens to raise their price, there are many competitive Linux server providers out there. Compared to the cost of paying for software on the market, I like the guarantee of a low price, and the ability to migrate away with no changes to my workflow if prices do change.
  * **Note**: cost is indeed a big factor. and who would understand this better than me cuz i just bought a sub for this(matter) thing. 

but i feel the time factor counterbalances it. you might pay 10$ to buy a software and on the other hand $6 for a server to host your own tools, but in the latter you'll also have to invest a 100 hours and its a known thing that time is precious. so really those 4$ extra is in exchange for the time.

for him maybe he has a lot of time, but for people like me, students, its difficult to invest a lot of time into things like this.
* tools can constrain our thinking
* Conversely, great tools that parallel our minds can multiply our creativity and productivity, by removing the invisible friction of translating between our mental models and the models around which the tools are built.
* I’m an extreme case. I don’t think everyone needs to go out and build their own productivity tools from the ground-up.
  * **Note**: just what i mentioned earlier.
* extensions of your mind and yourself
* Search for tools that view the world and your work the way your mind does, and prefer tools that can grow with you over time, the way that works best for you.
* at least 1700 hours in total
  * **Note**: wasn't very far off after all
