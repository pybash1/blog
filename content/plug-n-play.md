So, I recently got my hands dirty by building an Obsidian plugin for analyzing sentiments in your notes. Not an original idea of course, it was inspired by [750words](https://new.750words.com), which I recently discovered. I'm not a fan of their UI, and I think I'd rather write in Obsidian, if I had to. The plugin basically implements the "stats" part of 750words into Obsidian using GPT-4.

## Inspiration
I really liked the concept of analyzing your writing as it helps you see what you are mostly focusing on everyday, and also helps you improve from there([Allez on her post in why she quit 750 words](https://www.allezelizabeth.com/2019/12/01/why-i-quit-750words-com/)).
