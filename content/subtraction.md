title: "Subtraction: Why is it Hard?"

It's difficult to be different. It always has been. Most people prefer the *safe* and cozy place, the rat race. However, that is where most people go wrong. It is a known fact, that leaving your comfort zone and facing this vast world, especially "society" is very difficult and often harsh. But unfortunately, that is something which is important in today's world. Thomas Bevan, explains this very well in his post about [avoiding the middle](https://thomasjbevan.substack.com/p/avoid-the-middle). He says the "middle" is the most dangerous even though it is thought to be the "safest".

## Why?
That's in fact a million dollar question. Indeed, being different is hard. Most people think you're wrong. Most people think you won't make it. Everyone thinks you'll fail, but only you know you're doing the right thing. This is what society has normalized.
