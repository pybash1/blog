I don't write often, but when I do, I try to write something that will _inspire_ people. And sometimes, I just have fun âœ¨

My writing focuses on my _experiences_ and learnings of building and _crafting_ experiences through code and my journey through life. Occasionally, I write about random tidbits. I don't expect this to be a very professional however I do expect it to be navigable, and honest.
